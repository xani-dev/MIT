# ToDo List âœ…
My very First ToDo List App

This App was created using CSS, HTML, JSX, and React. 

## Description: 
This Project is a ToDo list app, to understand CRUD, making use of React components, and as an intro to useState

You can add and delete as many tasks as you wish, the current list has a few pre-rendered tasks for Demo purposes.

## Technologies:
* HTML & CSS
* JSX
* React

## How to Run: 
In order to run this project, you should open the index.html file and just start adding your own tasks. There's a console log that will print which task has been removed, if any. 

Have fun! 

## Future improvements: 

- [ ] Mark completed to-do's without deletion, for a better tracking experience.
